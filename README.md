## üéØ Overview

House price prediction is a popular real-estate problem where we try to predict the price of a house based on various attributes. This project uses machine learning regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict house prices based on a given set of features.

## ‚úÖ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
- **Model Training**: Building models using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize models.
- **Evaluation**: Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R¬≤ to evaluate model performance.
- **Feature Importance**: Understanding which features most influence house prices.
